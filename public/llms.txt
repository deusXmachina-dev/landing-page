# deusXmachina - Robot Fleet Energy Optimization

## About
deusXmachina helps manufacturing companies optimize their industrial robot fleets to dramatically reduce energy consumption and costs. We specialize in process-level optimization that complements manufacturer hardware optimizations to unlock additional savings of up to 30%.

## Product
- **Service**: Robot fleet energy optimization
- **Target Users**: Manufacturing facilities with industrial robots, production line managers, sustainability officers
- **Robot Types**: All payload categories (Small <16kg, Medium <60kg, Large <225kg, XLarge >225kg)
- **Deployment**: Integration with digital twins or deployment during maintenance windows

## Key Benefits
- **Lower Energy Bills**: Save thousands of euros per robot annually
- **Greener Operations**: Reduce CO₂ emissions significantly (tonnes per robot fleet)
- **More Reliable Lines**: Less mechanical wear and tear, increased uptime
- **Typical Savings**: 20% energy reduction, with potential for 10-30% improvement

## How It Works
- **Input**: Target takt time and robot program
- **Output**: Optimized motion parameters
- **Approach**: Process-level optimization that complements vendor hardware optimizations
- **Integration**: Works with existing digital twins or fits into maintenance windows

## Typical Results
Based on standard robot fleet configurations:
- Small robots (< 16 kg): 1.2 kW average consumption
- Medium robots (< 60 kg): 2.0 kW average consumption
- Large robots (< 225 kg): 4.5 kW average consumption
- XLarge robots (> 225 kg): 7.0 kW average consumption

Example savings for a fleet of 50 small, 20 medium, 10 large, and 2 XLarge robots operating 5,000 hours/year at €0.18/kWh over 5 years:
- Baseline consumption: ~800 MWh/year
- 20% reduction: ~€28,500 annual savings, €150,000 over 5 years
- CO₂ avoided: ~320 tonnes over 5 years
