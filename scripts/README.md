# HTML Entity Fixing Script

This script automatically fixes `react/no-unescaped-entities` ESLint violations by replacing unsafe HTML entities in JSX text content with their properly escaped equivalents.

## What it does

The script scans all `.tsx` files in the `src/` directory and replaces:

- `'` (single quotes) ‚Üí `&apos;`
- `"` (double quotes) ‚Üí `&quot;`  
- `<` (less than) ‚Üí `&lt;`
- `>` (greater than) ‚Üí `&gt;`
- `&` (ampersand) ‚Üí `&amp;`

## Smart replacement

The script is designed to be safe and only replaces entities in JSX text content while avoiding:

- Attribute values (e.g., `className="my-class"`)
- JavaScript expressions (e.g., `{someVariable}`)
- Import/export statements
- Comments
- Already escaped entities

## Usage

### Run the script manually

```bash
npm run fix-entities
```

### Integration options

1. **Pre-commit hook**: Add to your Git hooks to automatically fix entities before commits
2. **CI/CD pipeline**: Run as part of your build process
3. **IDE integration**: Set up as a task in your editor
4. **Watch mode**: Run when files change during development

### Example output
