## 15. Changes to the Terms

## 16. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict‑of‑law rules. Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and you consent to their jurisdiction and venue.
