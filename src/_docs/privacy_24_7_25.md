# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 24 July 2025_

SenseFlow, Inc. (“SenseFlow”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the websites available at **senseflow.io** and **app.senseflow.io** (the “Site”) and any early-access or beta services we may offer (together, the “Services”). We may also use temporary or testing environments (e.g., senseflow-io.vercel.app) that mirror the Site. This policy explains, in plain English, what we collect, why we collect it, and how you can reach us about your data.

---

## 1. What we collect
We keep this lean and only collect what we need to run and improve the Services:

- **Call data** – call history/metadata (time, duration, participants), call recordings, and transcripts.  
- **Contact info you give us** – email address, name, company, role, phone number, etc.  
- **Technical/session data** – IP address, device/browser info, and basic logs needed to keep the site secure and functional.  
- **Support messages or feedback** – anything you choose to send us by email or forms.  

> We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive personal data.

---

## 2. Why we use your data
We use the information above to:

- Provide and operate our calling/communication features  
- Secure, debug, and improve the Site and Services  
- Respond to your requests and provide support  
- Send essential service-related notices (no marketing blasts)  
- Comply with legal obligations

---

## 3. Legal bases (for EU/UK users)
Our processing is generally based on one of these grounds:

- **Legitimate interests** (running and improving our Services)  
- **Consent** (e.g., when you sign up for anything that clearly requires consent)  
- **Contract** (providing requested Services)  
- **Legal obligation** (where required by law)

---

## 4. Cookies & similar tech
We currently use only essential/session cookies and similar technologies required to run the Site. We do **not** use analytical or marketing cookies right now. You can block cookies in your browser; some parts of the Site may not work properly.

---

## 5. Sharing & vendors
We don’t sell personal data. We may share limited information with trusted service providers who help us host, deliver, analyze, or support the Services (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery). They only access your data to perform services for us and must protect it.  
We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property.

---

## 6. Data retention
We keep personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above, then delete or anonymize it. If you ask us to delete your data, we’ll do so unless we must keep it for legal reasons.

---

## 7. Your rights
Depending on where you live (e.g., EU/UK GDPR, California CPRA), you may have rights to:

- Access, correct, or delete your personal data  
- Object to or restrict certain processing  
- Receive a portable copy of your data  
- Withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent)

To exercise rights, email us at **call-me-maybe@senseflow.io**. We may need to verify your identity.

---

## 8. Children
Our Services are not directed to individuals under 18. If you believe a child provided us data, contact us and we’ll delete it.

---

## 9. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 10. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top reflects the latest version. Material changes will be highlighted on this page.
