# Terms of Use

_Last updated: 24 July 2025_

These Terms of Use (the **“Terms”**) are a legal agreement between you (**“you”** or **“User”**) and **SenseFlow, Inc.**, a Delaware corporation (“**SenseFlow**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”). They govern your access to and use of our websites (including **senseflow.io** and **app.senseflow.io**) and any related products, software, or services we provide (collectively, the **“Services”**).

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 2. What SenseFlow Provides
SenseFlow offers communication/calling tools and related features (including call history, recordings, and transcripts). We may launch or retire features at any time. Some parts of the Services may be offered as beta or pre-release; those parts are provided “as is” and may change without notice.

## Fees & Payment

## 3. Your Responsibilities
You agree to:  
- Use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.  
- Obtain and maintain all required consents and notices for recording or transcribing calls, as required by applicable laws (e.g., one-party or all-party consent rules).

- Not upload or transmit malicious code or infringe others’ rights.

We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms.

## 4. User Content & License
“**User Content**” means any data, audio, text, or other material you submit, upload, record, or otherwise provide through the Services (including call recordings and transcripts).

- You retain ownership of your User Content.  
- You grant SenseFlow a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, process, transmit, and display User Content as needed to provide and improve the Services and to comply with law.  
- You represent that you have all rights necessary to submit the User Content and grant this license.

We may remove or disable content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or applicable law.

## 5. Intellectual Property
The Services (excluding your User Content) and all related intellectual property are owned by SenseFlow or our licensors and are protected by law. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Services for your internal business purposes.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services, nor reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services
The Services may integrate or interact with third-party products or services. Those are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services and do not control their content or practices.

---

## 7. Privacy
Your use of the Services is also subject to our **Privacy Policy**, which explains how we collect and use personal data. By using the Services, you consent to our data practices as described there.

---

## 8. Beta / Experimental Features
From time to time, we may offer features marked as alpha, beta, preview, or otherwise pre-release. These are provided for evaluation purposes only, may be changed or discontinued at any time, and are provided “as is” without warranties.

---

## 9. Disclaimers
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.

---

## 10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SENSEFLOW BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF **(A) USD $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICES IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE**.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability; in those cases, the above limits apply to the fullest extent permitted.

---

## 11. Indemnification
You will indemnify and hold harmless SenseFlow and our officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claim, demand, losses, or damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your User Content; or (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

---

## 12. Termination
You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if we believe you have violated these Terms or if we stop providing the Services. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity) will survive.

---

## 13. Changes to the Terms
We may update these Terms occasionally. When we do, we will change the “Last updated” date above. If changes are material, we will take reasonable steps to notify you. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

---

## 14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware (United States), without regard to its conflict of law rules.

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and you consent to their jurisdiction and venue.

---

## 15. Export & Compliance
You must comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws. You represent that you are not located in, or a resident of, any country embargoed by the U.S. or listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

---

## 16. Miscellaneous
- These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and SenseFlow regarding the Services.  
- If a court finds any provision unenforceable, the rest remain in effect.  
- Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.  
- You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign them in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
